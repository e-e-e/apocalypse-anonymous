          I was talking tonight with the only friend I consider a fellow doomer, and I was so grateful for the change I’ve had to study, mourn, accept, reflect, and converse.  I’ve come to the conclusion that I am finally psychologically and spiritually ready. Thank you to all of you here who support TRUTH and are able to let go of hopium.

I then, heard more starting in around 2003-4... but really began to study around 2005... learned we needed to make changes NOW (2005,6,7,.).... in order to avoid the WORST..... but only in 2010 +... that I realized it was becoming ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE EXTINCTION IMMINENT... the thing that used to fuck with me before that... was ....why doesn't try to make the change NOW... YESTERDAY... to avoid sea level rise or food shortages..?... every time I read or heard something... it was about the end of the century, "SO, WE CAN LOOK DOWN THE ROAD TO MAKE SERIOUS CHANGES.".... or something along those lines.. I was ENRAGED... I understood ... you can't change  AFTER YOU SEE THE CLIMATE CHANGE.... it made no sense... I was "waiting" for the GOVERNMENT to IMPLEMENT SERIOUS ECONOIMIC CHANGES, rearranging the way we live... because what can the individual really do in a globalised economy?... BUT ALAS ....

I think more and more children, teens and youth will be wondering what does all this Climate Chaos mean to their future. Little do they know that they are the "Apocalyptic Generation" maybe even the last generation ever.

          I notice that most preppers are planning for at least some level of defense, whether that be guns, ammo, knives, being a grey man, or whatever. We're ready for, or have at least thought of, how to prepare for a SHTF situation where we might need to defend ourselves.
          Do any of you plan for scenarios where you need to be the bad guy? Maybe you only plan a food supply of a week or two, and your plan for a SHTF situation is to go on the offensive? Do you already have targets planned out?

            <p><b>Qpla3:</b> That’s not prepping. That is called being a shit human.
            <br>
            <b>Hkxm7:</b> If your first instinct when thinking about disaster preparedness is "Ooh, I'd better start thinking about how to pick out who I'm going to target," then I sincerely hope you end up being one of those looters who gets cut in half by a homeowner's 12 gauge after you try and rob him. You are a sociopath, and no one should pay you any mind.

            <br>
            <b>Tywa4:</b> Two questions to the "holier than thou" group that 100% reject the idea: 1) In a worst case SHTF situation (not a hurricane or temporary/regional disaster), most non-preppers are going to start to run out of food within a week. Would you turn away starving strangers that approach you in good faith while you sit on a 6 month or 1 year+ supply of food? From what I've read, most people would. Suddenly, the morals aren't quite so clear. You're not the good one that you naively think you are. You're the greedy hoarder that has no problem watching others die. That loss of moral high ground makes it a lot easier for someone to justify taking what's yours.
            2) What do you intend to do in a SHTF situation when you run out food and there are no other options. If you and your family are going to starve to death, and you have a well fed neighbor that has turned you away, will you and your family sit there and die quietly while you see them grilling over the fence?

          Well, this is it, folks. It’s one thing to abstractly expect the coming doom, but it’s another to actually live it. I just accepted the heart-wrenching offer of a last-minute flight out of Orlando, with Hurricane Irma only hours away.  My husband is staying behind because, unfortunately, his 80 year old father refuses to leave. The stores are insane; water and fuel price gouging is rampant, and the highways are fully jammed so I'll be driving alone tomorrow via back roads in north FL and GA to avoid getting stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on I-95. I can’t help but ask if this is the right decision? How can I abandon my family when I know there is no escape anyway?  All I know is, I felt my survival instinct take over.  My partner says he will feel better knowing I am safe.  An insane ride of stress, fear, denial, and anger.  I have to start packing now.  I thought I was prepared because of reading this group for so long, but nothing compares to the real thing.

           I find myself grieving a lot already. For the frogs, the robin, the trout. The tree that was tipped over by the wind. It was such a perfect tree and I caught it on camera the winter before it died, in a postcard perfect mountain landscape. I even grieve for the mice. It took me ages to unpack a mousetrap and attach the cheese. They may have survived the dinosaur extinction, but will they pull through this time? And of course I grieve for my nephews and my niece. I grieve for the melt rivers turned into wadis, for my Pet Glacier whose days are truly numbered.

          It was horrible we needed rescue on Tuesday morning after the flood water kept rising at our place. The worst situation with the power off my wifi was gone and I had limited to no signal on my cell. I was able to get a signal and posted on fb to get me out. My friends frantically tried to get anyone to my place and one guy said the coast guard was coming in 90 minutes. I spent the next 5 hours waving my light on flashing mode to the sky untik the sun came up. Then I was able to ask again and I then a neighbor in a boat finally came to our rescue. We then picked up another couple down the road and were brought to dry land where a another couple in a big truck picked us up. They brought us to a neighborhood on Keith that was dry and told us to go in as we had no where else to go. It was their parents house. They were strangers and opened up thief home to me and my family plus another family and 3 dogs after we were rescued. They sheltered us, fed us, comforted us, and let their home be our home for 4 days and 3 nights. He had almost 20 people at his place and they were nothing but generous to us and those around having a neighborhood dinner almost every night. They were ready for anything with a house stocked with food, guns, boats, big trucks, and a generator fueled via a natural gas line. We were so lucky to have been taken in by them after our rescue. The whole family was going back and forth down Keith road helping and rescuing all who needed help. We were lucky to be there and to have them take us in when we had nowhere else to go. On Saturday my brother in law drove from San Antonio and drove through the muddy trail which was the only access to us and got us out. It's been horrible but we have our lives and we will rebuild. #409strong

          How long to I have?  Do I have a future? I'm 19, in college. Stressing about future internships and jobs. I have some inherited money, but I still want to work for myself and make my own way.
          Then I come to this sub, I read about global dimming, climate change, some sort of crazy dangerous earthquake/tsunami happening on the west coast next month?(why haven't I seen that on the news? Shouldn't people be evacuating?)
          Like, it just seems very futile, what am I living for?
          Do I have atleast a decade of normalcy before a collapse happens? Like a collapse big enough to make me migrate...

            <p><b>Lpsa2:</b> This is the worst part about this sub. Its horrible because it makes you confront your mortality.
                I can only offer you this; Plan long term, but live each day... really live it. Keep life simple. Play games with friends... go clubbing... dont focus on what can kill you, but what you can do to really live a life.
                <br>
                <b>Plav8:</b> Confronting mortality is a good thing though. Any of us could die at any time, and it's foolish not to take that into account when making life decisions.
                Death is the only wise advisor that we have. Whenever you feel, as you always do, that everything is going wrong and you're about to be annihilated, turn to your death and ask if that is so. Your death will tell you that you're wrong; that nothing really matters outside its touch. Your death will tell you, 'I haven't touched you yet.'
                <br>
                <b>Ruty7:</b> I do think it's good to remember our mortality. Don't waste your time here. Don't work jobs you hate, or only work them so you can afford to do things you love. Don't waste your life with friends that treat you like shit. Don't waste your life doing bullshit because you feel like you have all the time in the world. You don't.
                <br>
                <b>Qwsc9:</b> I like this group because it reminds me that just like we are all mortal, our own society has some sort of mortality too. People go through life wasting their time because they feel like they have all the time in the world. Just the same, people imagine society will always succeed and we'll always have some expectation of safety. Just 60 years ago, the world was tearing itself apart and true fascism was a real threat to our existence. Most of us didn't grow up with that, but that doesn't mean we will never experience something like it. A lot of us should be thankful that we can sleep at night with some expectation of safety, and the expectation that someone with guns and combat training will come to save us if we dial 911 in an emergency. Things could be a lot different.

          I find myself drawn to the seemingly mundane lately. Everything is so insurmountably surreal and random. Everything. This comforts me. Perhaps it is just another form of denial, but as they say, all is dream.

          I hugged a tree today for the first time. I think it was about 200 years old. I ran my hands over its craggly bark...I looked deep into its veins on its trunk...I said out loud that I was sorry...I had water running down my cheeks. I felt it...what I was doing... I felt it. I've never hugged a tree before...it won't be the last time.

          I was just pondering the reality of the post apocalyptic life. And I found myself thinking about nuclear power plants, and natural disasters. I couldn't help but wonder, if in the post AP life how will the survivors shut down the power plants and prevent an even further meltdown? Or if you do survive, what is the point if everyone else is dead or a zombie? Or if you can't ever speak to someone else because your the only survivors? Who will be your friend? Your spouse? Just curious is all.

                <b>jdue7:</b>I've been thinking about that a lot lately. That's why I have a month of supplies. If some sense of normalcy hasn't returned, or if I haven't been rescued by then, I'd assume shtf in a bad way, and I'm not sure I'd want to be around to see it.
                <br>
                <b>Surt5:</b> Agreed
                <br>
                  <b>Qouh8:</b> We watched The Road the other week. There are definitely scenarios when I'd rather not survive
                  <br>
                  <b>Uwhn7:</b> I would rather survive it to later kill myself rather than die initally and not get a chance post SHTF.
                  I am not really prepared for a nuclear holocaust or Seveneves situation anyways.
                  <br>
                  <b>Mndi9:</b>  If I'm alive then there is still hope for a good future for me. If I'm dead then that hope is gone.
                  Plus I'm curious to see what the world will become and I'd like to live to see as much of that as possible.
                  The sad reality though is that if civilisation actually ended I'm not likely to survive that long even if I were a master survivalist. I have pretty bad asthma and once my stockpile of medication runs out, it will only be a matter of time before an asthma attack kills me. However I love my wife and I want her to survive so I'll stay alive as long as I can to make sure she doesn't have to do the hardest parts of this (setting a self-sufficient life up) alone.
                  <br>
                  <b>Hfhd2:</b> I'm just going to wing it with whatever I have in the house or can get my hands on in the first couple days after "it" happens. If things get dire I'll just find a cool way to kill myself. The glory of life without a spouse or offspring...
                  <br>
                  <b>Sjru8:</b> Sometimes I just want to see how bad things can get.
                  <br>
                  <b>Wasq6:</b> No. I have a medical condition that will be unsurvivable should it really hit the fan - even if I looted allllll of the pharmacies, the medication I need degrades very quickly. I prep for the survivable shorter term SHTF scenarios. Beyond 6 months I'm toast anyway.
                  <br>
                  <b>Lkfh8:</b> I figure why not? There's always a chance things'll get better, expect when your dead.
                  <br>
                  <b>Evyt5:</b> I figure I really do want to survive, even horrors, roughly up to the point of the atmosphere not being breathable for an extended period of time. After that I guess it might be possible to spend increasing amounts of time in underground bunkers/artificial farms of some sort, scrabbling in the dirt maybe growing maggot farms and fungus, but quality of life is made of quality of moments, and at some point it's definitely not worth it.
                  The reality is that if there is no power in Canada in the winter I might last a month, maybe two. My health problems and sub zero temperatures are a probably fatal mix.
                  <br>
                  <b>Eusj3:</b> Yes. My son and my elderly mom need me, for starters.
                  I've survived brain cancer, a dangerously abusive spouse who killed, credible death threats, a plane losing engine on takeoff (more scary than real danger since it landed safely, but still--scary!), homelessness, and other fun stuff.
                  I know I want to live. The end of the world can suck my left tit. :)
                  <br>
                  <b>Eudh0:</b> Yes, because you will find a new paradigm, a new normal. Prepping gives you the ability to ease into things as you learn the new rules, rather than dying within the first week.

          I have to laugh every time I read yet another article declaring Millennials to be the most selfish and narcissistic generation ever.
          As if wrecking the biosphere and the economy simultaneously was something they should be grateful for.
          As if they chose to be preyed upon by capitalism and globalism in such ways.
          Somehow, they are to build a perfect future out of the clusterfuck we left them. Anything less is the character fault of an entire generation.

          What I observe is an irony of actions and words concerning climate catastrophe. I talk about dire future events to my children and yet I am extremely conservative in my consumption and my spending. It's as if I am preparing for a future if living arrangements should remain relatively the same. My children, on the other hand, dismiss my dystopian fears entirely and then spend and consume as if there will be no tomorrow. They insist I am the one with a negative attitude.I will point out that their actions appear as though they are the ones not expecting a future. Conversation is over.

          Literally, we need to talk about shit, specifically what people need to do in situations when the toilet won't work, when the shit literally hits the fan. This is a criminally under-rated aspect of prepping for SHTF situations.
          <br>
          Say if a big city falls to a blackout, water doesn't work. Are people supposed to go out into their yards? And If you’re stuck in a basement or bunker due to extreme civil unrest or disaster - shitting in a tub seems like a lacklusture and unsafe option.
          <br>
          So let's talk about shit and all the possible ways to fulfill the duties nature calls upon us to do and how to do so to maximize health, safety, and comfort; in that order.

                  <b>Gamr8:</b> put the pool noodle on the rim of the bucket for comfort and to secure the black trash bag.

                  <b>Rmcr2:</b> Priorities Man!  Splurging on some 2-ply could be the difference between life and death.
                  <br>
                  <b>Brdc3:</b> I live off grid and handle all of my own waste by myself. I use a 5 gallon bucket and sawdust. If you don't know where to get sawdust, you can use horse bedding from a rural king/tractor supply store. Just add a bit of water before you use it and it turns from pellets into sawdust. Every time I use the bathroom, I put a scoop of sawdust over top.
                  I have a compost pile where it all goes. I have 2 heavy duty tarps at the bottom of the pile, and 8 layers of thick cardboard on top of the tarps.
                  Every time I empty the bucket onto the pile, I put some hay or straw over top. I never have flies or bugs on it, other than worms. No smell either. There are mushrooms everywhere on it. It makes great compost for fruit trees and even after a few years you could use it in your garden.
                  Been doing this for 2 years with 2 people and the pile is about 6 feet x 6 feet x 2 feet tall.
                  Leaching it not really that much of an issue with all the sawdust absorbing everything. Its probably overdone, but I did it that way just to make sure.
                  It only takes about 3 months before it just looks like beautiful compost by the way. It breaks down incredibly fast. When I take a shovel to the pile there are hundreds of composting worms all over it. It smells wonderful too.
                  My pile is about reached it limit and I'm going to start a new one. I'll let this one age for another year and then it gets spread to my fruit trees. I'll also use some on fruiting plants like Okra, peppers, tomatoes, eggplants, etc. Anything that the water has to travel up a stem and isn't on the ground means that it will be further filtered before being eaten.
                  Depending on where you live you might have to water your pile. And make sure to include as much urine as you can to your pile. Urine is full of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and lots of trace minerals. Everyone has about enough nutrients in their daily urine output to grow enough wheat to make a loaf of bread.
                  I never water my pile and its always moist, but I have it in the shade, in the woods and I also receive about 60-70 inches of rain per year. I made sure to move to a place that got a lot of water. Its the most important resource .
                  <br>
                  <b>Ros17:</b> Thanks again for the info. I'll have to water mine as it is crazy dry here.

          Sigh, bad day yesterday. Was late to work cause I was watching a Guy McDepression video. Then one patient after another with undiagnosable illnesses that aren't responding to treatment. I'm overwhelmed, sad, and confused. Full up of other people's pain and my own. Constantly thinking about trying to figure a way to have money but not work so much so I can live a less stressful life. Waiting for sudden disaster in the world like I'm going to get smacked in the face when I'm not looking. NTHE colors everything. Thanks for being here friends.

          What should I teach my children to prepare them for Impending Collapse? Does anybody else think about this very practical stuff - how to live during the time between the crash of the economy and physical/government infrastructure and the actual final days?  "food" is (I.e. How to scavenge and what kinds of bugs are the best protein), knowing how to build a composting toilet, build a shelter, etc, Or do people here think it will be much faster than that? I tend to think there will be a period of "dark ages" before human life becomes totally unsustainable. I just don't know how long that would last though. Thoughts appreciated.

                <b>Jodi0:</b> Thanks David. I appreciate your comments (and support). I do plan on moving - right now I live in NYC. There is no way we can stay, no access to land/food/water and waste issues . . . and I'm afraid of how violent people will get. I definitely plan on seeking out a like-minded community so we can hopefully have some more security. It's a relief to hear someone else talking like this.

                <b>Brjn6:</b> The more rural the better. When it all comes down and the supply chains break down basic competence the boys learn in that rural setting will be key. If you hook up with others, you can work together. One, there is strength in numbers and two, if the people around you are prepared they wont be needing to get violent with you.
                <br>
                <b>Gamr8:</b> I agree with all of you. I'm moving also next month from th suburbs of Montreal to the country in the mountains up north. Still rains normally here and snow every year so the forest in Quebec are not dry. Hope my kids and grandkids join me when the time comes.

                <b>Mfnt7:</b>  Teach them to be close to nature, tablets and iphone as well as hi-technology would not probably last long during a systemic collapse... Teaching them some permaculture skills is probably the best thing u could do i think...
                <br>
                <b>Rand1:</b> Think less about practical ways to survive in the future and focus on living in the present to the fullest. Plan to help your family suffer as little as possible, (quickly and painlessly) when things unravel to the point when "survival skills" become necessary
                <br>
                <b>Annd9:</b> I have a child and a grandchild and yes I taught my son those things I thought would give him resilience and I and my son and her mother teach my granddaughter to be self-confident and resilient too. Survival skills are good, but so is the idea that l deserve to survive.

          Any Aussies here who are deep into prepping?
          I'm only asking because our country presents some very interesting hurdles to prepping.
          I mean, guns are banned here and you can't buy any, anywhere, except under extremely special circumstances - so we can't stock up on guns and ammo for a SHTF scenario. How do you get around this?
          We have extremely venomous snakes and spiders, the worst in the world afaik. We'll need to figure out a way to get the antidotes somehow? How? If we bug out and go into the wilderness, we might get bitten and die horribly without them.
          Our country is HUGE and very hot. This means that travelling long distances is a big problem - overheating vehicles, overheating people etc.
          We do however, have a small number of Aboriginal tribes living off the land left over from the Colonization - they have some of the best survival skills of any peoples on Earth. I'm going to travel into the Outback and live with them if possible.
          If you're an Aussie prepper, let me know how you've prepared. :)
          Cheers.

                <b>Pix3:</b>  It's pretty easy to not get bitten by a snake or spider in Auz. I do it all the time. Consider gaiters if you like for the snakes. Don't know perhaps I've just been lucky, stupid or both all this time.  Guns are not as hard to get hold of as you make out, many people own them for recriational hunting and professional farming / land management needs.
                  <br>
                  <b>Hobn5: </b>I live in a suburban area - guns aren't on my radar.
                  How would you get guns? Raiding a police station?
                  <br>
                  <b>Pix3:</b> No if you needed a gun you would go through all the normal legal methods of obtaining them and getting the training now. I do not personally own any but know several people who do. It's not such a problem for them.
                  With the gun laws the way they are it simply means that very few people own them so the need to own one your self is diminished.
                  <br>
                  <b>Avec1:</b> Don't assume you can get something difficult to come by now after a major "SHTF" (as you put it) scenario. If you don't have it now, you will not be the first person trying to get it after.
                  Also, trying to raid a police station seems like a bad idea. They are probably good places to hole up if they can be defended. If they are not defended or still manned by some semblance of police I would truly assume there is nothing left. Try to go through the legal steps to get a hunting rifle if you can.

          1. Here’s my prediction for how it’s gonna go down:<br/>
          2. Current global population size can only be sustained by use of fossil fuels because it was fossil fuel use that created the current global population size.<br/>
          3. Fossil fuels are acidifying the oceans and destroying marine ecosystems.<br/>
          4. Billions of people rely on fisheries to remain as they are in order to stay live.<br/>
          5. Climate change is increasing the rate and severity of droughts.<br/>
          6. Billions of people rely on agriculture to remain as it is in order to stay alive.<br/>
          7. Billions of people will starve to death.<br/>
          8. Hundreds of millions of people will migrate to other countries for food.<br/>
          9. Each successive country the migrants reach will destabilize.<br/>
          10. Creating even more migrants which will accelerate global instability.<br/>
          11. Disease will be widespread because of the mass human migration.<br/>
          12. Infrastructure will collapse due to the pressures presented by civil unrest, disease, and starvation.<br/>
          13. Collapsing the infrastructure needed to feed the population.<br/>
          14. Seven billion people starve to death<br/>
          15. Disease will be rampant, killing any collection of people.<br/>
          16. Extremely isolated populations will disintegrate after hundreds of years due to insufficient population size and strained ecosystems.

                <b>Hgut8:</b> Good guess.
                <br>
                <b>Lkam2:</b> There is a perfect storm heading our way. Economic collapse, depletion of fossil fuels, depletion of arable land, sea level rise, lack of antibiotics, devastation caused by climate change, etc. All this combined will create instability that will be visible at first in 3rd world countries. 3rd world countries are least prepared to handle this pressure, are dependant on foreign aid (it will drop significantly due to economic collapse) and are most affected by climate change.<br/>
                This instability will lead to mass migration. EU is weakened greatly by 'mere' 2 million migrants. But this time there are 2 billion migrants knocking on her door. EU will have to either spend mountains of live ammunition or risk being overrun by african/ME mobs. However, EU will face difficulties herself and allowing a lot of angry refugees in is not a good idea. These refugees will be first to wreak havoc when resources are running low.
                I think you are spot on that migration spreads like a virus and leads virtually all globe into a permanent civil war state. People won't be very nice when they are starving.
                On a side note, maybe Trump is onto something. His policy is to build a wall (keeps out masses of illegal immigrants until they starve to death on other side of the wall). At the same time, he pushes fossil fuel industry and denies climate change. Maybe he does believe it and realises that it's unavoidable.
                I'm not questioning any more whether collapse will happen. We are facing too many huge problems at once. I'm only trying to figure out how to survive it the very best way possible. If there will be billion people surviving it, I want to be one of them.

          <br>
          Given the problems facing us, how do the people here feel about having children and bringing new life into this world. Even if Inevitable Collapse is not considered inevitable, it seems very clear that the future is going to be very difficult for those of us around (climate chaos, overpopulation, war, collapse, food/water shortages, etc...).
          I used to want to have children, but over the past year or two I have changed a lot and now wonder whether that is really the right thing to do. The problem is, my wife still very much wants them. She still has her head in the sand in regards to a lot of the issues facing us, and would rather just not know and try to be optimistic about things (which I envy, in a lot of ways).
          On one hand, I think that we should all make the best of the time we have left on this planet, and if I can make my wife happy I want to do that. But on the other hand, I'm just not sure how I could raise a child feeling the way I do about the future.

It is not about condemning people for past choices, which may have been made with limited information; rather, it's about recognising fact, facing reality and responding accordingly.

          <br>
          I was hospitalized in 2003 after a nervous breakdown the night after I watched a documentary climate change and had a vivid and terrifying dream about abrupt collapse. I was above Earth and watched as the polar ice caps melted rapildy and the land surfaces turned brown and smoldered. I didn't even know what climate change was then. I was 13 at the time. It was so distressing to me I tried to kill myself the next day, my parents rescued me from the brink of death. The doctors told me later I had a brief psychotic episode resulting from that dream but dismissed my concerns on climate change altogether. I all but forgot about it and went on with my life. Here nearly 15 years later at age 28 I feel like I got a glimpse at the future. I currently find myself stepping back and taking it all in like everything I'm seeing is a documentary about man's final days. I'm no longer married after an extended illness. I don't plan on having any children either. It seems cruel. I want to just get out and travel and live as much as I can with the time we have left but I'm still caught in this machine of debt and social responsibility as if it really matters anymore. Can anyone relate to the last part at least? Why not just pack a suitcase and head for the hills, so to speak? Or even end ones life?

I sometimes have a drink before bed so I can sleep better, but it's not going to make the climate chaos go away. We deal with relentless dry here and running out of water, while the rest of the country floods!! Today there is a nasty cold gale it's the third row. It's exhasting sometimes to deal with one thing after another as well as reading all the ten thousand reports of climate chaos. Take one day at a time, it's the only thing that works for me right now.

          I survived a hurricane. My house didn't flood, but only barely. I'm a pretty serious prepper, but after living through this I've learned quite a bit.
            <ol>
                <li>Check and gather your light sources. Keep them in one place. Have enough D batteries to last a lifetime. Candles work too, but large lanterns are better. Also invest in headlamps.</li>
                <li>Get serious about storing gas for a nice generator. At least 30 gallons. Even though the storm is long gone we still can't get gas. A nice generator is your best investment. Check out the Honda's. If you live in an environment with extreme heat also invest in a small window AC that can be powered with your generator. Make sure you have all of the big cords and things you'll need to run this whole set-up. Practice that set-up now.</li>
                <li>Make friends with a few key neighbors if you haven't already done so. Not just for helping each other, but to have people to pass the time with. You can share information, drink together, the kids play together, and just in general people to commiserate with. We also pooled our perishable food at times to make complete meals.</li>
                <li>Make sure you can take care of yourself and your kids without help from your spouse. Learn how to run the generator, chop a hole in the roof, turn off the gas, and other various things.</li>
                <li>Make a plan for waste management. We have now gone 10 days without a trash pick-up.</li>
                <li>Pharmacy. Our grocery stores opened up days before our stand alone pharmacies. Once the grocery stores open back up, it can take about four hours to complete your trip. Have an account at a pharmacy that's located inside a grocery store with a drive thru! If you need medication you can drive thru and avoid waiting in that grocery store line.</li>
                <li>Gas. Just expect to not be able to get gas before, during, and after an emergency. They did sometimes have diesel.</li>
                <li>Keep your pantry stocked at all times. There is no reason not to keep a few months of canned and dry goods. Same with water. During a disaster the stores are closed, and then the store shelves are bare. They limit your purchases of eggs, milk, bread, and water... and that's if they have those things. Produce, lunch meat, regular meat, and cheese are hard to come by. Its been a week and I still can't get bread.</li>
                <li>Have a good quality set of walkie talkies. Should you have to evacuate, you can caravan out as a family. Each driver has a walkie, and you can signal each other to change lanes as a group and to make stops as a group. Cell phones will most likely not work.</li>
                <li>Prepare for natural disasters. So much prepping focuses on the extremes...civil unrest, the collapse of government, a pulse weapon that takes down the grid, a super volcano, etc. These things may happen, but there is a low probability. You're more likely to experience an earthquake or a flood or a hurricane or a tornado. Prepare for those things specifically.</li>
            </ol>
          A quick list of things that flew off the shelves and continue to fly off the shelves... water, bread, eggs, milk, produce, meat, dust masks, large buckets, contractors trash bags, flashlights, D batteries, gas cans, and gas.
          Lastly, have enough to help others. Be prepared to assist the elderly neighbor that can't evacuate, or the child that needs food, etc. When we got the call that they were desperate for supplies at the shelter, I was very thankful that I was prepped enough that I could help others. I mostly saw elderly folks, and lots and lots of children. Many had been rescued from homes that have never flooded. Helping others is extremely important for your morale and general attitude in a disaster.

          Where can I find that database of information for rebuilding society?
          I've seen old posts about a 13GB or something data folder that has all the information you need to rebuild society post-collapse. All those posts, however, lead to dead domains. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

                <b>Drft6:</b> Let an old man ramble, apparently:
                The kicker is that most books are best for before the emergency, right?
                When wisdom catches hold, as it likely will, an a prepper shifts his focus form bugging out to bugging in, and eventually realized that he needs to grow plants and harvest meats for a self-sustainable life, he'll start valuing books like "5 acres and independence". but it's about useless to 'have on hand' it's a motivation book. Even when you're homesteading, you need chicken manuals and fence repair and veterinary manuals and planting guides long before you need One Second Actor.
                But you might've not ever started the journey if you never read One Second After, so which is the best book?
                These days, i recommend the same way I recommend shop tools or project lists - Work with what you've got in front of you. If you've got a project you want to do, read 5 books about it. If you've got a skill you want to learn, read 5 books about it.
                I read a phrase once, and I can't find it now, but it went something like this - "Read one book and you'll know more than half of folks about the topic. Read 2 books on it, and you'll know more than 3/4's of them. Read a third book on it and you'll know more than anyone not getting paid to know as much as they can about it." Fine that it's not a hard fact, right? but it holds.
                And by getting the books you need for the project ahead of you, you're not getting a library you dont' use; they won't be tools gathering dust, waiting for their best appropriate use. The worse tools in my shop are the ones I bought when I didn't need them (to be fair, I tell myself they were bought because they were smoking deals, and they were)
                Get the books you need. not the books you should have.

          Hey guys, thought it would be good to share my home checklist summary:
            <ul> </li>
              <li>Water: 15 gallons per person.</li>
              <li>Food: non-perishable, long shelf life, easy to make or ready to eat.</li>
              <li>Fire: storm proof matches, lighters, and a fire starter.</li>
              <li>Light: candles, crank or battery powered flashlights or lanterns.</li>
              <li>Heat: mostly from clothes and blankets, but also propane heaters and survival blankets.</li>
              <li>First aid: must be more than just a “boo-boo kit,” should handle more serious injuries.</li>
              <li>Medication: Tylenol, activated charcoal, digestive aids, prescriptions.</li>
              <li>Hygiene: hand sanitizer, camp soap, baby wipes.</li>
              <li>Communication: crank or solar powered NOAA radio, flares, whistle.</li>
              <li>Cash: small bills, as much as you can afford to stash.</li>
              <li>Documents: copy of deeds/titles, insurance policies, birth certificates, maps, etc.</li>
              <li>Tools: work gloves, wrench for your gas lines, zip ties, duct tape, sewing kit, etc.</li>
              <li>Self defense: depending on personal views, up to and including firearms and ammo.</li>
           </ul>
            Notice that this summary does not include a few things you commonly see in other emergency preparedness checklists. We assume you already have things like clothing, blankets, cooking utensils, feminine hygiene products, garbage bags, toilet paper, etc.
            Sometimes other checklists mix the home supplies pieces with the bug out bag evacuation pieces. We split them up because they are distinctly different uses, it helps prevent double dipping, and reduces the chance gear is scattered and unprepared.

          I'm thinking of trying to get a seed bank of sorts going in I'll ever need to start growing my own food, in case of economic down turn or something like that. Thing is I'm completely new to this and I'm not sure how to go about it, should I just start growing my own food now? Is there any container I'd need to keep good for the long term? Do seed even have a shelf life? I know they dig up usable seeds out the ice that are thousands of year old but what about for normal conditions and storage? What are your guys experience with this.

                <b>Slot2:</b> might as well learn early - pack everything away like you won't be touching it again for 5-10 years - it just might happen ....
                sealed containers like a bucket with a locking lid and gasket are all purpose - color code with a band of electrical tape around the top and a master inventory letter & number - include a desiccant pack for moisture control ... if it's a bucket that needs eazy/quik/frequent access you use a Gamma lid ...
                for bundling and protective needs a 5'' wide roll of stretch wrap is essential ...
                instead of flimsy totes I went to poly pop coolers - seals against the environment and cushion protects - pop coolers are a great asset for post-SHTF usage ....
                another great tool is a vacuum sealer - blister pack parts on paperboard - condense packs like clothing and bandages - protects and organizes - even does the original job in the freezer .....

                Do you mean your closet? Your finished basement? Store in original packaging, in food grade buckets. If you buy #10 cans of food, just store them on a shelf where they'll stay dry.
                Do you mean in some pit you dug in your backyard as a weekend project that took 3 months and 2 trips to the ER? It's full of mold, setting foot in it is dangerous. Even if it wasn't it, it's likely going to collapse and/or flood before you need it.

          There will be very few of us around that will die from catastrophic altering of the climate. The majority of people on the planet will die from the collapse of civilization or nuclear war which ever comes first.. we all face our own personal extinction.. I have no fear of that or dying.. what I fear is pain and suffering which there will be no limit of in the wake of collapse or nuclear war. I'd hope for the latter, maybe get lucky and be vaporized in a thermonuclear blast than to be someone's lunch, tortured or hacked and bludgeoned to death after the collapse. What a time to be alive!

          <b>Prec0: 10 December, 2016</b>
          <br>
          Hello everybody! My first day here and am I ever glad that such a place exists! I have been working through the stages of grief since about 2012 and at the end of June of this year I finally accepted the reality of the inevitability of near term human extinction. I have been writing poetry ever since. And thank you very much for the clear and reasonable position on discussions of suicide!
          So first off, I just wanted to say I love you all. I don't know why, it's probably a defence mechanism or something, maybe a consequence of my tribal nature or spiritual beliefs, but to the group of people who have clearly seen the end of all life on earth in the near term and formed and joined a support group - I love you!
          The liberation of moving beyond hope - a space I explore everyday - the privilege ya know? I am young and poor, but I have no dependants, so that is okay. I have booked my vasectomy and got my doctor to explain to the government that I am no longer capable of working. Practical steps, practical steps. And, because I don't mind living with my parents, the teeny tiny amount of money I get from the government is enough to pay for therapy, wherein, after working on trauma and self worth, we are now working on the fear of death. How lucky am I?
          I just wanted to share that, so much, with people who would understand. There is no redeeming quality to near term extinction, and our choices are clear, but at least now I have a place to share my poetry without alienating people I love . Thanks so much for being here, and thanks for reading. Poetry to come soon!

                <b>Eudh9:</b>  Welcome Prec0. Struggling on in spite of overwhelming data gives my life meaning. I am vegan and drive a Prius, recycle, though it ultimately won't mean anything. What does have meaning is the struggle and the refusal to give in, and being an angel of mercy to human and non-human animals in spite all the evil and suffering to come. In spite of it all, I still believe in a spiritual universe. But again, welcome, welcome.
                <br>
                <b>Prec0:</b> Absolutely agree. I love the oneness, and the oneness loves me. In fact, the oneness loves us all. Everything is connected and has a consciousness. The organizing principle of the universe is love.
                <br>
                <b>Uebh5:</b>  A year or two ago I was looking at a National Geographic book of photos taken by the Hubble telescope. Looking at those hard-to-imagine expanses of swirling gases and radiation, I was hit by the wonder of what a miracle it is that we exist at all. That we can have this exchange. Look around at the weird assortment of fellow travelers. And bask in this moment.

                <b>Dklm5:</b> The U.S. military is the biggest CO2 producer in the world. Bigger than any country. Do you think they are cutting back? When they do, I will. Besides I think it is too late to reverse course anyway.
                <br>
                <b>Kxcv0:</b> Just do it, ya know? your personal impact is negligible, and it is way to late to be worrying about that. There is 10 degrees C of warming locked in for the next ten years because f what we have already done. We are all free to see this beautiful planet in its death throes how ever much and how ever we want - there is nothing we can do to stop the change - it has already started. The earth will get to hothouse no matter what.it was too late in 1999. Please, I am begging you, if you can follow a dream like that, if there is even a chance of you being able to follow such a dream, please do it! that sadness, that profound cosmic sadness, can be carried. Please my friend, live now, with a sense of urgency. i love you.,

          An organisation just called me to see if I would like to attend a conference on solar panels. The poor man was sorry he called me and was terrified by what I said I had learned in the last 3 years he then wanted me to come and speak at this conference I declined as I told him I would rather spend my time immersing myself in the beauty of a sunset and give thanks for the day with the hope that I will get to be present for the sheer miracle of another one.

                That's on Keith road right down the place from where I live on Beaverbrook. It was horrible we needed rescue on Tuesday morning after the flood water kept rising at our place. The worst situation with the power off my wifi was gone and I had limited to no signal on my cell. I was able to get a signal and posted on fb to get me out. My friends frantically tried to get anyone to my place and one guy said the coast guard was coming in 90 minutes. I spent the next 5 hours waving my light on flashing mode to the sky untik the sun came up. Then I was able to ask again and I then a neighbor in a boat finally came to our rescue. We then picked up another couple down the road and were brought to dry land where a another couple in a big truck picked us up. They brought us to a neighborhood on Keith that was dry and told us to go in as we had no where else to go. It was their parents house. They were strangers and opened up thief home to me and my family plus another family and 3 dogs after we were rescued. They sheltered us, fed us, comforted us, and let their home be our home for 4 days and 3 nights. He had almost 20 people at his place and they were nothing but generous to us and those around having a neighborhood dinner almost every night. They were ready for anything with a house stocked with food, guns, boats, big trucks, and a generator fueled via a natural gas line. We were so lucky to have been taken in by them after our rescue. The whole family was going back and forth down Keith road helping and rescuing all who needed help. We were lucky to be there and to have them take us in when we had nowhere else to go. On Saturday my brother in law drove from San Antonio and drove through the muddy trail which was the only access to us and got us out. It's been horrible but we have our lives and we will rebuild. #409strong

          <br>
          Here in MD, beginning of Sept, the oak leaves are beginning to fall to the ground. But, my english laurel and other holly bushes are all putting on new growth, just like in spring. And today, I happened across this:
          <br>
          <img src="static/media/flower.jpeg"/>
          <br>
          A bloom - I started to tear up - too much for this old woman to take - especially one with grandkids...

                <br>
                <b>Laop8:</b> More people should be observing and sharing the multitude of odd things happening this year. It is not just the heat. Bugs, more allergies, trees ,animal behavior
                Meanwhile I love our blooming magnolias, azalea, and jonquils which are abundant in our strange spring. Due to get a cold blast from the Antarctic tomorrow.
                Magpies in Australia used to start nesting and swooping in mid/late September in the 80's.....this year the first ones started mid August.
                In Auckland we've had Monarch caterpillars and butterfly’s all year!
                I hear you about the children. That is the hardest thing for me to accept. My own death, OK. Their deaths? I can't wrap my mind around that.
                <br>
                <b>Qwla9:</b> Here in WI, a few nights ago the garden/ tomatoes froze &#128539; Now, once again, it's 90F.
                <br>
                <b>Wiud7: </b>In my town - Magnolias and rhododendrons in flower in the garden.
                I have noticed that everything this year has come up early and blooming was ahead of schedule too.
                <br>
                <b>Lkjd3:</b> I look at it as Nature doing what she can While she can.It is exactly as we should be doing- spend time with family. BE HERE, right now...cos tomorrow may never come.
                <br>
                <b>Uehd9:</b> Texas too.
                <br>
                <b>Quwi9:</b> Yes, the seasons are getting messed up, I had spring blooms in fall a couple of years ago. I also am so heartbroken for my grandchildren and my kids.
                <br>
                <b>Lame8:</b> Last month and July here it was cold enough for hot water bottles. Last night, it ws 21.5 degrees C in our north facing bedroom. Today - 38 degrees C in a sheltered garden! I'm glad I don't have children, but I grieve for the life my neices, nephews and grand-nephews won't have.
