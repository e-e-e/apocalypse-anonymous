      DESCRIPTION:
      Hi everyone! This group is for information, support, and sharing of our skills for coping with inevitable, imminent human extinction.
      We are a group of people that identify as doomers.  We are aware of that there is no turning back from ecological and societal collapse as a result of global human intervention into the environment:  population overshoot, global warming, industrialisation, & overconsumption are the nails in the coffin.

      We welcome the full range of emotions and responses to impending collapse: anger, sadness, fear, compassion, as long as the discussion is respectful.  We live in very difficult times personally and collectively, and this group was formed to help folks transition through those times. Personal posts regarding your ecological anxieties are always appreciated, and please be supportive of your fellow members. This is also a place to share evidence of our coming extinction, as well as your plans for how to confront it. Jokes, poems, limericks, cartoons, music, personal videos/photos, and art are also welcome. Please preface any articles containing “hopium”; this is a safe space for doomer ideology.

      Important reminder: please refrain from discussing illegal activities -- topics which include cannibis/illegal drugs as well as suicide/assisted suicide. This is important for numerous reasons.
